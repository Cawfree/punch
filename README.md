# punch (in development)
A graphical programming language which uses the [Spatial Programming Paradigm](https://www.scribd.com/document/330109881/On-Spatial-Programming).

## What's in it for me?
You'll find a library useful for deterministic real time dynamic layout animation,( and a demonstrable example of the signed distance vector rendering software [ribbon-vg](https://github.com/Cawfree/ribbon-vg) for desktop environments.
